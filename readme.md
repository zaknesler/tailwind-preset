This is a Laravel front-end preset for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). This preset replaces the default Bootstrap scaffolding, including the example Vue.js component. It also compiles the assets using [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/jeffreyway/laravel-mix) for convenience and [PurgeCSS](https://github.com/fullhuman/purgecss) to generate the smallest files possible.

### Warning
Laravel presets are meant to be used with a fresh installation of Laravel. Installing this preset will **overwrite** your existing views and assets. Please install with caution.

### Installation
To install this preset, you must first require the composer dependency in your application. Laravel will automatically register the service provider for you.

```
composer require zaknesler/tailwind-preset
```

Now, install either the `tailwind` or the `tailwind-auth` preset. The `tailwind-auth` preset includes the authentication scaffolding normally generated when `php artisan make:auth` is executed.

```
php artisan preset tailwind

// or

php artisan preset tailwind-auth
```

> **Note:** If you install the `tailwind-auth` preset on a version of Laravel that is older than 5.7, you may delete the `views/auth/verify.blade.php` file, as it will not be used.

Install the NPM packages using your favorite package manager.

```
yarn // npm install
```

Now you can compile the assets using any of the Laravel build scripts (dev, prod, watch).

```
yarn dev // npm run dev
```

Ensure that your database is properly configured and migrated, and you're done!
